# Covid-19 Tableau_Project
#### I have created 8 visualizations to analyze and understand the effects of Covid-19 in India and Globally.

This is the simple demonstration of how we can create different and interesting charts, visuals and dashboards from same data.

The following questions we asked and then created visuals from Covid-19 Dataset.

## The primary goal of my visualizations is to analyze:
### 1. What is the percentage of people infected in the year 2021?
